# Tmall Product Image Retriever

A simple Python script to retrieve product images from Tmall

## Usage
1. Put all the product links into a text file, one link per line
2. Run the script and specify the location of the file above
3. Product images will be saved at the same folder of the text file under folder "images" and the product ID is used as the subfolder name
